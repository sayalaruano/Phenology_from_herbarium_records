INITIAL LIST

The initial list comprised the processed list of 444 unique species validated with the MOBOT database.

SYNONYMS SEARCH

I used an in-house R script to retrive the synonyms of the 444 species from the Tropicos database using 
the taxize R package. The script is available in the "retrieve_synonyms.R" file.

After applying the in-house script, we obtained a list of 2908 records of the orginal species and their 
synonyms. This list is available in the "List_all_species_phenology_proj_UDLA2022_with_synonyms.csv".

Also, I created a list with the number of synonyms for each of the original 444 species, which you can 
find in the "List_all_species_phenology_proj_UDLA2022_number_synonyms.csv" file.
